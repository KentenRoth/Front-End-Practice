# Front-End-Practice

I will be building out random front-end components and landing pages in this file. Each folder will have its own README to explain what I was building.

I found an article by Matt Suddert on Dev.to and will be building out a few of the things I seen on there.

For these I want to use my own color schemes. I'm not very good at design and making colors to go together, but the only way to get better is to work at it.
